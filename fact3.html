            The Consitution is the governing document of the United States. The preamble begins by saying, "We the People," symbolizing the emphasis on a people driven government, with politicians being servants of the people. 
            The Consitution is also an ever changing document to make up for the times. Ammendments can be created to change or add to the Consitution, such as the bill of rights. However, ammendments are very difficult to create, and need a huge majority of certain legislative departments.
            The Consitution remains today as the governing document of the US. It still can be seen today in the The National Archives Museum in Washington DC.
